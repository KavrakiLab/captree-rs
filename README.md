# Collision-Affording Point Trees: SIMD-Amenable Nearest Neighbors for Fast Collision Checking

This is a Rust implementation of the _collision-affording point tree_ (CAPT), a data structure for
SIMD-parallel collision-checking against point clouds.

## Usage

The core data structure in this library is the `Capt`, which is a search tree used for collision checking.

```rust
use captree::Capt;

// list of points in tree
let points = [[1.0, 1.0], [2.0, 1.0], [3.0, -1.0]];

// range of legal radii for collision-checking
let radius_range = (0.0, 100.0);

let captree = Capt::new(&points, radius_range);

// sphere centered at (1.5, 1.5) with radius 0.01 does not collide
assert!(!captree.collides(&[1.5, 1.5], 0.01));

// sphere centered at (1.5, 1.5) with radius 1.0 does collide
assert!(captree.collides(&[1.5, 1.5], 0.01));
```
